Synopsis for KNN :
knn :: [(String,[Double])]->[Double]->Int->String
knn takes a list of training data , each element being a 2-tuple of the label and the coordicates of point , a point to classify and 'k', and outputs the resultant label.
for example : refer to src/KNN/knn_test.hs

Synopsis for KMeans :
kmeans :: Int->[[Double]]->[[[Double]]]
kmeans takes 'k' and a set of points(as a list of list) and returns k clusters of points.
for example : refer to src/KMeans/kmeans_test.hs

Synopsis for NaiveBayes :
train :: Classifier -> String -> String -> Classifier
train takes a classifier, a new input document, the respective class of it and results a new classifier
classify :: Classifier -> String -> (String,Double)
classify takes a classifier and a document to be classified and results the class with maximum probability 
for example : refer to src/NaiveBayes/naiveBayes_test.hs

Synopsis for LSA :
lsa :: [String]->Int->(Matrix Double,Matrix Double,Matrix Double)
lsa takes a set of documents and the number 'k' (estimate of number of topics in documents) and results the U,sigma,trans V matrices mapped to k dimensions
for example : refer to src/LSA/lsa_test.hs

Synopsis for SVM :
train_svm	:: DataSet -> Double -> Int -> LeastSquareSVM -> Solution_SVM
train_svm is used for training- input: training dataset with labels, epsilon and max_iter for conjugate gradient algorithm and output: Support vector solution i.e. weights,support vector,bias b.
test_svm :: Solution_SVM -> Array_doublesList -> LeastSquareSVM -> [Double]
test_svm takes input solution and test_datapoints, gives the list of labels as output.
