Library of Machine Learning Algorithms in Haskell

1. CLustering:
	Partitioning Based-
	a). K-means(Divyanshu)
	b). K-medoids
	Hierarchichal Based-
	a). Agglomerative Hierarchichal CLustering
	Density Based-
	a). Any of the DBSCAN, OPTICS or DENCLUE
	Grid Based-
	a). Any of the STING, CLIQUE, Wave Cluster
	Model Based-
	a). Probabilistic Model Based
	
	Some of these may really seem vague but implementing these will give our project an edge over others. :)

2. Classification:
	a). Decision Trees
	a_). Random Forests
	b). Association Rule Mining
	c). Naive Bayes(Divyanshu)
	d). Bayesian Networks
	e). SVM(Pathak)
	f). ANN(Hingo)
	g). KNN
	h). Case-based reasoning Lazy Learner

3. Regression:
	a). Linear(Ajmera)
	b). Logistic(Ajmera)

4. Ensembling:
	a). Bagging
	b). Boosting
	c). Stacking

5. Special Mining
	a). Hidden Markov Models
	b). Text Mining Algorithms
	c). Web-Mining Algorithms
